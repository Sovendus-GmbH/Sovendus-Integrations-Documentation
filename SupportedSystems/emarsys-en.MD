# Connect Emarsys

1. Sign up to [leadthing.dev](https://leadthing.dev) and purchase a subscription

2. Get the leadthing.dev API key

3. Create an API key as described [here](https://dev.emarsys.com/docs/core-api-reference/a12e08c686f0f-2-set-up-your-account), for the initial setup phase we need permissions to read/write contacts, readt contact lists, and fields. As we need to use the API to lookup the field ID's to craft our API request configuration

4. Create a list of Field Names you want to be populated for each new account and an example value for each (screenshots from an example contact are fine)

5. Temporary create a user for sovendus to access you emarsys dashboard as we need to check if our test contact has any issue.

6. Get the contact list id where the leads should be added to

7. Send the Newsletter System name, the API key, the name of the fields with example values and the contact list id to Sovendus
